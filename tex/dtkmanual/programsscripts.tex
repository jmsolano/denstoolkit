\chapter{Programs}
%**********************************************************************************************
%**********************************************************************************************

In this chapter, a description for each program of \DTK{} is provided. The description given here is a bit more detailed than the description offered in each individual help menu of the programs.

Whenever possible, we will provide an example of how to run the program, and after \S\ref{sec:commonopts} it will be assumed that a file called
\wfexfile{} (which should be included along with the source code) exists and is the main input of the program under review.

%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{General behaviour}
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

%..............................................................................................
\subsection{Input files}
%..............................................................................................

All the programs belonging to \DTK{} suite read wave function files. These files can be obtained by Computational Quantum Chemistry packages such as Gaussian~\cite{bib:gaussian09}, GAMESS~\cite{bib:gamess}, or NWCHEM~\cite{bib:nwchem}. \DTK{} can read either the old \texttt{wfn} files or the newer \texttt{wfx} files~\cite{bib:webwfxformat}.\footnote{Some incompatibilities may arise when mixing files between Windows and Unix-like operative systems. Please ensure that the files \texttt{wfx} or \texttt{wfn} use the same newline as the operative system where \DTK{} is running. For this, you can use the programs \texttt{dos2unix} and \texttt{unix2dos}.} Wavefunction files can be obtained indirectly from other formats through
the program \href{https://github.com/zorkzou/Molden2AIM}{molden2aim} \cite{bib:molden2aim}.

The wave function file is \textbf{\textit{always}} the first argument in the command line.
The only exception is when requesting the displaying of the help menu (which actually
does not evaluate anything). Thus, the usage of every program in \DTK{} obeys the
following pattern:
\begin{lstlisting}
$dtk*** inputname.wf? [option [value(s)]] ... [option [value(s)]]
\end{lstlisting}
Here, the stars represent any of the programs in \DTK, the question mark can be \texttt{n} or \texttt{x}, and the options (with possible values) are specific to each program.

%..............................................................................................
\subsection{Output names}
%..............................................................................................

Most of the programs included in \DTK{} produce some kind of output. The main output is numerical, and it is saved in different files. While the specific output depends on the particular program, there are a few conventions that we adopt. 

\begin{itemize}
   \item \texttt{\textbf{dat files:}} This type contains single or multi-column data and is used whenever a field is evaluated at a line (or a parametrized curve) of points (one-dimensional grid). In some output files of this kind, comments are added at the beginning of the file. These comments start with the character \texttt{\#}.
   \item \texttt{\textbf{tsv files:}} This file contains the information for two-dimensional grids. It is the format known as \textit{tab separated values}, and the files also may contain comments starting with the character \texttt{\#}.
   \item \texttt{\textbf{cub files:}} This file contains the information for three-dimensional grids. The format of these files is the standard \texttt{cub} format of Gaussian \cite{bib:gaussian09}.
   \item \texttt{\textbf{gnp files:}} These files are scripts to be parsed to gnuplot. They purpose is to provide basic scripts with non-trivial information about the system that is being plotted. For instance, the positions of labels in the plot, values for the parametrization when lines or planes are projected, colours for the atoms etc.
   \item \texttt{\textbf{pov files:}} These type of files are the input for the pov-ray tracer.
   \item \texttt{\textbf{cpx files:}} This type of file is a native file of \DTK. It contains the information of critical points. These files act both as output and as input. For more details about this format, see \S\ref{sec:cpxfilefmt}.
\end{itemize}

%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{Common options}\label{sec:commonopts}
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

All programs in \DTK{} share the following options:

\begin{itemize}
   \item \textbf{Help menu:} Usage and some details of the program at hand is displayed by means of
		\begin{lstlisting}
$dtk*** -h
		\end{lstlisting}
	or
		\begin{lstlisting}
$dtk*** --help
		\end{lstlisting}
   \item \textbf{Version:} The version number can be accessed by
   	\begin{lstlisting}
$dtk*** -V
		\end{lstlisting}
	or
		\begin{lstlisting}
$dtk*** --version
		\end{lstlisting}
   \item\textbf{Output name:} By using this option, the user can give a name other
   	than the automatic name generated by each program. The program at hand will invariably add
		the appropriate extension to the file-name, and any extension will be considered part of the name.
	   This option is particularly useful when one wishes to give a wfx(wfn) and out files located at
	   arbitrary directories, or to perform calculations with different parameters using the same wavefunction.
		For instance, the command
		\begin{lstlisting}
$dtk*** /arbitrary/path/input.wfx -o /other/path/othername ...
		\end{lstlisting}
		will invoke the program \texttt{dtk***} with an input wave function file located at
		\texttt{/arbit\-rary\-/path} and the output will be saved in the directory
		\texttt{/other/path} using the name \texttt{othername} with different extensions for the output.
   \item \textbf{Plotting the data:} Most of the \DTK's programs have the capability to create
   	scripts that can be passed to plotting/rendering programs such as gnuplot or povray. While
		the primary purpose of \DTK{} is to evaluate numerical functions, we are aware that the visualisation
		of the data is also important. With this in mind, and recalling that it is quite common to use
		severs dedicated to Molecular Quantum Mechanical calculations, we have found really
		convenient visualise data in a simple and quick manner. If a \DTK{} program has
		the capability of calling plotting/rendering programs, such a call is activated with
		\begin{lstlisting}
$dtk*** ... -P
		\end{lstlisting}
	   The programs that produce scripts (and internal callings) are: \texttt{dtkline}, \texttt{dtkplane},
	   \texttt{dtkfindcp}, \texttt{dtkmomd}, \texttt{dtkproject6dto2d}, \texttt{dtkbpdens},
	   \texttt{dtkqdmol}, \texttt{dtkgetnciplot}, and \texttt{dtknci}.
   \item \textbf{Compressing data:} Some programs have the option to call \texttt{gzip}.
   	If this option is available, it can be activated with the following command line:
		\begin{lstlisting}
$dtk*** ... -z
     \end{lstlisting}
     The programs that provide this option are: \texttt{dtkline}, \texttt{dtkplane}, \texttt{dtkcube},
     and \texttt{dtkmomd}.
     \item \textbf{Open-shell wavefunctions:} If a molecule has an open-shell configuration,
    		for some fields, you will need to activate the option \texttt{-J} to read the information.
			If your molecule has non-singlet multiplicity, you must request your Quantum Chemistry
			package (Gaussian, ORCA, nwchem, etc.) to write the information of single-spin natural
			orbitals, \textit{i.e.}, not to use ``\texttt{Alpha and Beta}'' orbitals, but
			``\texttt{Alpha}'' or ``\texttt{Beta}'' orbitals.
		This option works only with \texttt{wfx} files, as \texttt{wfn} format does not support
		single-spin molecular orbitals.
		Because even if your molecule is open-shell, the molecular orbitals can still be written
		in an ''\texttt{Alpha and Beta}'' orbitals, \DTK{} subprograms will not try to read
		single-spin orbital information automatically. Instead, this must be explicitly requested through
		the option \texttt{-J}.
\end{itemize}

%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{dtkpoint}
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This program calculates all the implemented properties at a point or at a set of them (see \S \ref{sec:availablefields}). Additionally, the program will perform the integration of the electron density over the whole space (which should render the molecule's total number of electrons). The program takes the wavefunction file and calculates the fields at the point(s) given by the user. The point(s) for the fields can be given in three different forms:
\begin{itemize}
   \item \textbf{Cartesian coordinates}. The fields are calculated at the point $(x,y,z)$. Example:\\
      \begin{lstlisting}
$dtkpoint ciclopropano_pbe6311.wfx -c 0.75e0 -5.0e-01 1.2e0
\end{lstlisting}
   \item \textbf{Set of Cartesian points.} The fields are calculated at a set of points given in an input file. For example, if the file \texttt{coords.dat} contains the coordinates, then the syntax is:\\
      \begin{lstlisting}
$dtkpoint ciclopropano_pbe6311.wfx -i coords.dat
\end{lstlisting}
      
      The file \texttt{coords.dat} contains the following data:
      \begin{verbatim}
#Comments accepted by dtkpoint
1.1e0 2.04e-2 1.45e+1
2.3e0 -4.4e-2 3.31543e+00
#Another comment between coordinates
2.3e0 4.4e-2 -3.31543e+00
      \end{verbatim}
      Every line that starts with the character ``\texttt{\#}'' will be ignored,
      and comments can be placed at any line of the input file. This program
      does not perform any check on the coordinates input file, therefore the
      user is responsible of providing a file that has $3N$ numbers, where $N$
      is the number of non-commented rows in the file. Each row corresponds to
      a point in the three dimensional space.
      \item \textbf{At a nucleus.} The fields are calculated at the position of a nucleus. Example:
         \begin{lstlisting}
$dtkpoint ciclopropano_pbe6311.wfx -a 2
\end{lstlisting}
   This will calculate the fields at the position of the 2$^{\textrm{nd}}$ nucleus listed in \wfexfile.
\end{itemize}

%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{dtkline}
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This program calculates one of the implemented scalar fields (see \S\ref{sec:availablefields}) along a line defined by two of the molecule's atoms. For instance, the ELF along the line that passes through the atoms labeled as 2 and 4 of the cyclopropane molecule (Fig. \ref{fig:cyclopmolline}) is evaluated by means of\\
\begin{lstlisting}
$dtkline ciclopropano_pbe6311.wfx -a 2 4 -p E -P
\end{lstlisting}
Here, the option \texttt{-a} tells \texttt{dtkline} to use the atoms \texttt{2} and \texttt{4} to define the line whereat the property will be evaluated; the option \texttt{-P} tells \texttt{dtkline} to create a pdf image using gnuplot; and with option \texttt{-p E}, one chooses the field ELF (see the help menu of \texttt{dtkline} for a complete list of fields ---below---). The final result, after some editing of the gnuplot script is presented in Fig. \ref{fig:cyclopelfline}.\footnote{Let us recall that \DTK{} facilitates the creation of quality-plots (for instance, by providing the projected coordinates of the atoms C$_2$ and H$_4$ along the line), but it cannot replace the human judgement for creating nice plots.}
\begin{figure}[hb!]
\centering
\subfigure[Cyclopropane molecule.]{\includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{cyclopQDMolLine}\label{fig:cyclopmolline}}\quad%
\subfigure[ELF along the red line of Fig. \ref{fig:cyclopmolline}.]{\includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{cyclopELFLine}\label{fig:cyclopelfline}}
\caption{Evaluating the ELF along the line that joins the atoms C$_2$ and H$_4$ (red line
of subfigure \subref{fig:cyclopmolline}) with \texttt{dtkline}.}\label{fig:dtklineuseex}
\end{figure}

Sometimes, it is convenient to increase/decrease the number of points to evaluate within the line. To do so, one can use the option \texttt{-n dim}, where \texttt{dim} is the new number of points. If this option is not specified, \texttt{dtkline} uses 200 points.

\textbf{Special cases:}
\begin{itemize}
   \item \textbf{Wave function with one single atom:} In this case, \texttt{dtkline} will use the single atom present in the wave function file and then define a line that passes through this atom. The option \texttt{-a} is ignored, thus it is not necessary to use it, however if used the syntax must include two numbers. It is recommended, if you are interested in single atom wave functions, not to use the option \texttt{-a}.
   \item \textbf{Wave function with only two atoms:} For diatomic systems, \texttt{dtkline} will use these atoms to define the line, and if option \texttt{-a} is used, it will be ignored. 
\end{itemize}

%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{dtkplane}
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

As the name suggests, this program evaluates a field upon a plane. \texttt{dtkplane}
defines a plane based on the choosing of three atoms. Once the atoms are given,
the program translates the plane until the centroid of the triangle formed by the
three atoms' coordinates coincides with the centre of a square. The size of the
plane is calculated such that all the atoms in the molecule are contained in
the plane, even if not all the atoms intersect the plane. Since there is no
restriction about the distance between the chosen atoms, it is assumed that
the user is interested in studying the field around those atoms. Therefore,
the produced script only contains one parameter (called ``dimparam'') to zoom in
the plotted region, \textit{i.e.} to zoom in the plot, you simply need to edit
the gnuplot script in order to decrease the value set for dimparam.

As an example, the command line
\begin{lstlisting}
$dtkplane ciclopropano_pbe6311.wfx -a 1 2 3 -p L -P -k -c -l
\end{lstlisting}
produces a gnuplot script that is the base for rendering the figure \ref{fig:cycloplolplane}. 
%
\begin{figure}[h!]
\centering
\subfigure[Cyclopropane molecule.]{\includegraphics[width=0.35\textwidth]{cyclopQDMolPlane}\label{fig:cyclopmolplane}}\qquad\qquad%
\subfigure[LOL evaluated at the blue plane of \subref{fig:cyclopmolplane}.]{\includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{cyclopLOLPlane}\label{fig:cycloplolplane}}
\caption{Evaluating the LOL within the plane that contains the atoms C$_1$, C$_2$,
 and C$_3$ (blue-ish triangle of subfigure \subref{fig:cyclopmolplane}) with \texttt{dtkplane}. The plot \subref{fig:cycloplolplane} was rendered by gnuplot.}\label{fig:dtkplaneuseex}
\end{figure}
%

In the above command line, the option \texttt{-a 1 2 3} is used to provide the atoms
used to define the plane. \texttt{-p L} is the option for choosing the LOL field
(see the menu help, below, for the complete list of fields); \texttt{-P} is for
rendering a plot (by calling gnuplot); \texttt{-k} is for keeping the gnuplot
script on disk; \texttt{-c} activates the contours on the plane; and \texttt{-l}
activates the labels of the atoms. By default, only the atoms used to define the plane
will be shown in the plot; however, if you need the plane-projected positions and labels of
the other molecule atoms, edit the gnuplot script and activate their display by
removing the character `\texttt{\#}' at the beginning of each line. Thre rest of the
options are:

\texttt{\textbf{-n}:} For increasing/decreasing the number of points per direction, one can use the option \texttt{-n dim}. This will create a 2D grid with \texttt{dim x dim} points.

\texttt{\textbf{-c:}} This option will print contour lines in the final plot.

\texttt{\textbf{-l:}} To add the labels of the atoms that were used to define the plane.

\texttt{\textbf{-L:}} This option will display the labels of every atom present in the wave function file. The positions are the projected position in the plane.

\texttt{\textbf{-v}:} This option will display information from third party programs such as gnuplot, gzip, etc.

\textbf{Special cases:}
\begin{itemize}
   \item \textbf{Wave function with one single atom:} In this case, \texttt{dtkplane} will use the single atom present in the wave function file and then define a plane that passes through this atom. The option \texttt{-a} is ignored, thus it is not necessary to use it, however if it is used, then the syntax must include three numbers. It is recommended, if you are interested in single atom wave functions, not to use the option \texttt{-a}.
   \item \textbf{Wave function with only two atoms:} For diatomic systems, \texttt{dtkplane} will use these atoms to define the plane, and if option \texttt{-a} is used, it will be ignored, however it must contain three numbers.
\end{itemize}

\section{dtkcube}\label{sec:dtkcube}
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This program evaluates a scalar field within a three dimensional grid. The data is saved
in a *.cub file, which is the standard cube format used by the Gaussian~\cite{bib:gaussian09}
package. This is perhaps the most computationally expensive program in \DTK{}, and also
one of the few programs that does not automatically produce any visualisation, however,
it can produce a \texttt{VMD} script that can be independently parsed to \texttt{VMD}.
Again, this script is only the basic starting script, which needs to be adjusted to render
adequate isosurfaces of the evaluated field.

The main purpose of \texttt{dtkcube} is to create standard output that can be
processed by advanced visualisation programs such as VMD. For instance, we produced
a cube file with the command line
\begin{lstlisting}
./dtkcube.x ciclopropano_pbe6311.wfx -p l -P -S 100
\end{lstlisting}
Subsequently, we used the cube file to to create the Figure \ref{fig:dtkcubeuseex},
using \texttt{VMD}:
\begin{lstlisting}
vmd -e ciclopropano_pbe6311LapRho.vmd
\end{lstlisting}
%
and selecting the view and modifying a few visualisation options. The isovalue was
0.22 a.u.
\begin{figure}[hb!]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{cyclopLap}\label{fig:cyclopLap}
\caption{Visualising an isosurface $\nabla^2\rho=0.22$ a.u., within a three-dimensional grid (cube). The plot was generated using VMD. }\label{fig:dtkcubeuseex}
\end{figure}
%
The option \texttt{-p l} tells \texttt{dtkcube} to evaluate the Laplacian of the electron density (see below for the complete list of available fields), \texttt{-P} tells
\texttt{dtkcube} to create a starting vmd script, and \texttt{-S 100} activates a \textit{smart} cube. Choosing a smart cube, minimises the number of trivial points, this is, we adjust the cube to be a rectangular cuboid such that it encloses the molecule and a few extra space around the most outer atoms of the molecule. This allows \DTK{} to skip the calculation of spatial points that offer only trivial information (since the wave function and its derivatives decay rapidly as the evaluation point moves away from the molecule). For instance, the cuboid generated by the example command generates a grid of \texttt{96 x 100 x 90 = 864,000} points, which is 86.4 \% of the points that would have been calculated if a normal cube had been evaluated.

\texttt{dtkcube} always creates the grid around the geometric centre of the molecule. This also reduces the number of trivial points in the final cube/cuboid. This criterion is different from
the procedure usually followed for creating wavefunction files (wherein the molecule's centre
is the charge centre).

If you want to save the information about wfx input file name, CPU time (time taken to evaluate the whole grid), and some other extra-information, you may want to activate option \texttt{-l}.
Such an option produces a \texttt{log} file which contains that information.

%..............................................................................................
\subsection{Managing the dimensions of the grid}
%..............................................................................................

\texttt{dtkcube} offers several options for custom requests:
\begin{itemize}
   \item \textbf{Default cube: } A default centred cube of \texttt{80 x 80 x 80} points is evaluated if no additional options are given.
  	\item\texttt{\textbf{-n dim}}: A centered cube of \texttt{dim x dim x dim} points is evaluated.
	\item\texttt{\textbf{-N nx ny nz}}: A centered cube of \texttt{nx x ny x nz} points is evaluated.
	\item\texttt{\textbf{-s}}: A \textit{smart} cuboid with the largest dimension being \texttt{80} is evaluated. The other dimensions are proportional to the molecule's dimensions.
	\item\texttt{\textbf{-S ldim}}: A \textit{smart} cuboid with the largest dimension being \texttt{ldim} is evaluated. The other dimensions are proportional to the molecule's dimensions.
\end{itemize}

In the current version, \texttt{dtkcube} does not rotate the molecule to minimize the cuboid dimensions, but only looks for the highest and lower values of the atoms' coordinates in all of the three axis. These values are the ones used to adjust the cuboid.

Also, in version \dtkversion, one can zoom in the cube by using the option \texttt{-c a1 a2}.
This option centers the cube at the midpoint of atoms \texttt{a2} and \texttt{a2}.
The grid is then setup around this midpoint with a lenght of 30 nm per side of the grid.

%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{dtkfindcp}\label{sec:dtkfindcp}
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This program searches critical points (CP) within a molecule. In version \dtkversion, the complete analysis is implemented for the electron density (ED). Partial implementation is offered for searching LOL critical points. In the future, additional fields will be implemented.

The complete search of critical points of a molecule can be found by the following command:\\
\begin{lstlisting}
$dtkfindcp ciclopropano_pbe6311.wfx 
\end{lstlisting}
This will find all the ED critical points (including ACPs, BCPs, RCPs, and CCPs), as well as the bond gradient paths (paths that connect ACPs with BCPs). The information of the critical points are saved into two files. The \texttt{log} file contains the coordinates of all CPs found, and the field properties at such points. The \texttt{cpx} file shares the coordinates of the CPs, but additional information is stored in these files, such as the coordinates of the gradient bond paths, and the name of the wave function used to perform the search of CPs.

\texttt{dtkfindcp} is also capable of producing \texttt{pov} files (and internal callings to povray) for rendering 3D images of the critical points. For instance, the Figure \ref{fig:cyclopCPs} was produced by typing\\
\begin{lstlisting}
$dtkfindcp ciclopropano_pbe6311.wfx -P -g -T -k -a
\end{lstlisting}
This command produces a \texttt{pov} file and calls povray to render the image displayed in Fig. \ref{fig:dtkfindcpusex}. The option \texttt{-g} tells \texttt{dtkfindcp} to display the bond gradient paths; and the option \texttt{-T} sets the style of the bond gradient paths to be tubes. On the other hand, Figure \ref{fig:cubaneCPs} was produced using \\\begin{lstlisting}
$dtkfindcp ciclopropano_pbe6311.wfx -P -g -T -k -r -a
\end{lstlisting}.
%
\begin{figure}[hb!]
\centering
\subfigure[]{\includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{cyclopCPs}\label{fig:cyclopCPs}}

\caption{Electron density critical points of \subref{fig:cyclopCPs} cyclopropane and
\subref{fig:cubaneCPs} cubane molecules. Blue lines are the bond paths joining the BCPs and the ACPs,
green lines are the gradient paths joining RCPs and BCPs, and orange lines are the
gradient paths joining CCPs and RCPs.}\label{fig:dtkfindcpusex}
\end{figure}
%

If you are interested only in finding the critical points, but you do not want to seek the gradient bond paths, you can deactivated the search of bond paths by using the option \texttt{-G}. In this version, the search of gradient paths connecting RCPs-BCPs and CCPs-RCPs is made only upon request with the option ``\texttt{-r}''. However, the algorithm for finding these last two types of gradient paths is not finished and should be used with caution.

Sometimes, depending on the complexity of a molecule, a simple search of critical points is not enough to find all of them. In such cases, you can request to perform an \textit{extended search}
by adding the option ``\texttt{-e}'' to the command line. This command will tell \texttt{dtkfindcp}
to make additional searches of critical points after the normal search.
 The extended search consists of setting, as initial searching points,
a set of points traced around (and included) the positions of each non-nuclear
attractor, Hydrogen-bond-like BCP, RCP, and CCP found during the normal search. The set of points
are drawn using the icosahedron vertices as reference, and they are traced with a distance from
the centre proportional to the maximum geometrically bond distance found in the molecule.

If you do not wish to create a \texttt{png} image, but you do want the \texttt{pov} file, using the option \texttt{-p} will accomplish that.

In addition to the \texttt{cpx} file, you can also save the coordinates of the critical points in a very simple format. Using the option \texttt{-m}, the coordinates of the critical points will be written into three different files. The names of these files will be created out of the \texttt{wfx(wfn)} file, or out of the output file name specified by using the option \texttt{-o outputname}. Different string will be added to the out names to identify which information they contain, and the files will obey the following formats:
\begin{itemize}
   \item The file ending with ``-ATCrds.dat'' will contain the atomic coordinates, and the format of such file is\\
   \texttt{AtomicSymbol \ AtomicNumber \ X \ Y \ Z}
   \item The file ending with ``-CPCrds.dat'' will contain the coordinates of all the critical points that were found. The format of this file is\\
   \texttt{??? \ X \ Y \ Z}\\
   where \texttt{???} can be ``\texttt{acp}'', ``\texttt{bcp}'', ``\texttt{rcp}'' or ``\texttt{ccp}'' to identify the signature of the corresponding CP.
   \item The file ending with ``-BPCrds.dat'' will contain the coordinates of the points of all bond paths, without further identification. This is, the coordinates are points that belong to a bond path, but there is no way to identify to which specific bond path the point at hand belongs to. The format is simply\\
   \texttt{X \ Y \ Z}
\end{itemize}

Some of the options for calling povray can be set in the command line. For instance, the camera position can be handled by using the option \texttt{-c p}, where \texttt{p} is an integer that gives the normal vector components where the camera will be placed at. \texttt{p} can be \texttt{001,010,100,101,110,111}. Every value is a three digit number that represents the components of a vector, for instance \texttt{101} means that the camera will be placed at a position proportional to the vector (1,0,1), and so on. Warning: this option is not really compatible with the custom angle views that can be modified in the pov file (see \S\ref{sec:povcustopts} for more details), and perhaps will be deleted in future implementations.

If you wish to create a \texttt{png} image, and keep the \texttt{pov} file all at once, you need to specify the option \texttt{-k} for not deleting the pov file.

Below you can find a brief description of the \texttt{cpx} file format as well as a short overview of the custom options that can be easily modified in the pov files which, in junction with the script \texttt{dtkpov2png}, can  be used to create custom images of the displayed properties.

Finally, in future implementations there will be the possibility to search critical points of different fields. In version \dtkversion, the LOL is partially implemented.

\subsection{\label{sec:cpxfilefmt}The \texttt{cpx} file format}
%..............................................................................................

We follow the same conventions as for the \texttt{wfx} file format \cite{bib:webwfxformat}. A \texttt{cpx} file is somewhat similar to an XML file, but with certain restrictions. We define opening and closing tabs, for instance
%
\begin{verbatim}
<WaveFunctionFileName>
 h2o.wfx
</WaveFunctionFileName>
\end{verbatim}
or
\begin{verbatim}
<CriticalPointType>
 Electron Density
</CriticalPointType>
\end{verbatim}
or
\begin{verbatim}
<NumberOfACPs>
 3
</NumberOfACPs>
\end{verbatim}

However, any opening or closing tag MUST stand alone in a single line. The purpose of this restriction is to accelerate the reading of the \texttt{cpx} file. This format does not contain tags with spaces.

For the purposes of the data (information between tags) a new line is considered as equivalent to a space or a tab character. There can be comments between two different tags, but comments between the data is not allowed.

Below we provide an example of a \texttt{cpx} file, which is the result of a search of critical points of the water molecule.

\#\textbf{WFX (WFN) file name} from which the the wave function of the molecule was obtained.
\begin{verbatim}
<WaveFunctionFileName>
 h2o.wfx
</WaveFunctionFileName>
\end{verbatim}
\#\textbf{Type of critical points:} This refers to the type of critical points, in terms of the scalar field. This is, this tag identifies whether the critical points are electron density critical points, LOL critical points, etc.
\begin{verbatim}
<CriticalPointType>
 Electron Density
</CriticalPointType>
\end{verbatim}
\#\textbf{Number of critical points:} The total numbers of critical points by signature identification.
We follow the conventional naming:
\begin{itemize}
   \item \textit{Attractor Critical Point} \textbf{(ACP)} is a CP with signature (3,-3), and corresponds to a maximum in the topology of the Fields manifold.
   \item \textit{Bond Critical Point} \textbf{(BCP)} is a CP with signature (3,-1), and corresponds to a saddle point where two of the Hessian eigenvalues are negative, and the third is positive.
   \item \textit{Ring Critical Point} \textbf{(RCP)} is a CP with signature (3,+1), and corresponds to a saddle point where only one of the Hessian eigenvalues is negative and the other two are positive.
   \item \textit{Cage Critical Point} \textbf{(CCP)} is a CP with signature (3+3), and corresponds to a local minimum in the field's manifold.
\end{itemize}
We are aware that the terms ACP, BCP, etc. loose their physical meaning when fields other than the electron density are analysed. However, the signature values remain the same, therefore this naming can be used for uniquely tagging a critical point.
\begin{verbatim}
<NumberOfCriticalPoints>
<NumberOfACPs>
 3
</NumberOfACPs>
<NumberOfBCPs>
 2
</NumberOfBCPs>
<NumberOfRCPs>
 0
</NumberOfRCPs>
<NumberOfCCPs>
 0
</NumberOfCCPs>
</NumberOfCriticalPoints>
\end{verbatim}
\#\textbf{CP Cartesian Coordinates}: The Cartesian coordinates of all critical points with a given signature. If there is no critical point of certain signature, the opening/closing tags will appear and there will be no data among the tags.
\begin{verbatim}
<ACPCartesianCoordinates>
  7.405253164682e-34 -1.481050632936e-33  2.403142046477e-01

<RCPCartesianCoordinates>
</RCPCartesianCoordinates>
<CCPCartesianCoordinates>
</CCPCartesianCoordinates>
\end{verbatim}
\#\textbf{Bond critical points connectivity}. This block contains the information of how the network of BCPs are related to the ACPS. This makes more sense for the electron density CPs, since for this case, a BCP is usually found whenever two atoms are bonded. For other fields, the rule of starting the search of a BCP in between every two ACPs generally applies, thus this information saves the history of where the seed for looking the BCP at hand was located.
\begin{verbatim}
<BCPConnectivity>
1 2 1 2
2 2 1 3
</BCPConnectivity>
\end{verbatim}
\#\textbf{Labels}: This set of tags stores the labels of all the critical points of a certain signature. For the electron density ACPs, we use the atom labels provided in the \texttt{wfx(wfn)} file. For other fields, we use also the atom label plus an extra label after the numerical index. The BCPs are labeled according to the ACPs that were used to start the search (the midpoint between each pair of ACPs). The RCPs' labelling involves all the atoms that were related to its search. And the same for the CCPs. Once again, if the number of CPs of a certain signature is zero, the opening/closing tags will be present, but there will be no data among these tags.

It is assumed that each label consists of a set of alphanumeric characters and hyphens. However, spaces in a label are NOT allowed. In fact for this tag, a space, a tab character, or an end line, all of them indicate the final of a label.

\begin{verbatim}
<ACPLabels>
 O1 H2 H3
</ACPLabels>
<BCPLabels>
 O1-H2 O1-H3
</BCPLabels>
<RCPLabels>
</RCPLabels>
<CCPLabels>
</CCPLabels>
\end{verbatim}
\#\textbf{Number of bond paths}: Self descriptive.
\begin{verbatim}
<NumberOfBondPaths>
 2
</NumberOfBondPaths>
\end{verbatim}
\#\textbf{Number of points per bond path:} There is no \textit{a priori} way to know how many points will be per each bond path, since they will vary in length and curvature. Therefore, the number of points that belong to each bond path is set in this tag. Notice that we already know how many bond paths were found (see above, ``NumberOfBondPaths'').
\begin{verbatim}
<NumbersOfPointsPerBondPath>
 21 21
</NumbersOfPointsPerBondPath>
\end{verbatim}
\#\textbf{Bond paths' data}: This block contains the coordinates of each point that belongs to a given bond path. The data contains two child tags ``BondPathIndex'' which is a number to identify the bond path, and is given just as a redundant mechanism to check the integrity of the \texttt{cpx} file; and ``CoordinatesOfBondPathPoints'' which contains the actual coordinates of each point in the bond path identified by ``BondPathIndex''.
\begin{verbatim}

Getting the right position of the povray's camera is a bit tricky, and we do not attempt to solve this problem in an automatic way. However, we provide a relatively easy-to-use tool to find an adequate view. The program \texttt{dtkqdmol} creates a quick view of the molecule, and since it is rendered via gnuplot, two view angles are displayed in the window (see \S\ref{sec:dtkqdmol}). You can adjust the view through the interactive gnuplot's window and then change the values of the defined variables \texttt{GNUPlotAngle1}, and \texttt{GNUPlotAngle1}. An extra angle can be specified in povray (which gnuplot does not use): the \texttt{YAngle} variable. For more information about this view angles, see the povray's documentation (under the ``camera's rotate'' section) or the gnuplot's help menu (\texttt{help set view}).

By default, all critical points are drawn with the same size. For setting different sizes, you can adjust the options ``\texttt{RadiusACP=RadiusAllCriticalPoints;}'' to your desired value. (Changing only the value of \texttt{RadiusAllCriticalPoints} will change the size of ALL critical points.)

The colours of the critical points are given by three numbers, corresponding to the red, green or blue saturation value, and they all must be numbers between 0 and 1.

The rest of the options are self descriptive, and the only note is to use \texttt{true} or \texttt{false}.

\section{dtkmomd}

This program evaluates the electron momentum density (EMD), \textit{i.e.,} the Fourier transform of the electron density. This single program may evaluate the momentum density for a single point; one, two and three dimensional grids. The output, if any, is written as explained below.

\begin{itemize}
   \item \textbf{Point (0D)}: No output is created, instead the value is displayed at the screen. This grid is set by the option \texttt{-0 $\mathtt{P}_\mathtt{x}$ $\mathtt{P}_\mathtt{y}$ $\mathtt{P}_\mathtt{z}$}, where \texttt{$\mathtt{P}_\mathtt{i}$} are the values at which the EMD is evaluated.
   \item \textbf{Line (1D)}: The output is written to a \texttt{dat} file and, in the current version, only lines parallel to the axis are implemented. This grid is accessible through the option \texttt{-1 x}, where ``\texttt{x}'' indicates the axis to be evaluated and can take the values ``\texttt{x}'', ``\texttt{y}'' or ``\texttt{z}''. Creation of gnuplot scripts is enabled for this grid (option \texttt{-P}).
   \item{\textbf{Plane (2D)}}: The data is saved into a \texttt{tsv} file, and in the present version, only planes normal to the axis are implemented (the planes contain the origin of the momentum space coordinates). To evaluate the EMD in a plane, one must use the option \texttt{-2 xy}, where \texttt{xy} are two non-spaced characters that indicates the plane whereat the EMD will be evaluated, and can be \texttt{xy}, \texttt{xz}, or \texttt{yz}. Creation of gnuplot scripts is also enabled for this grid (option \texttt{-P}).
   \item{\textbf{Cube (3D)}}: The values of the EMD are stored in a \texttt{cub} file (standard Gaussian cube file), and this grid is set by using option \texttt{-3}. For this grid, there is no immediate visualisation, but it needs to be produced through other programs such as VMD.

\section{dtkproject6dto2d}
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This program was previously named \texttt{dtkdemat1}, which evaluated the density matrix of order 1 (DM1) along a line, which can be the line that joins two atoms, or the bond path that connects those two ACPs. In this version, we have extended the functionality so as to include 6D fields projected along a line.
The new program keeps the capabilities of \texttt{dtkdemat1}, but in addition, other 6D fields can be requested. 

\texttt{dtkproject6dto2d} can be called, for example, by\\
\begin{lstlisting}
$dtkproject6dto2d ciclopropano_pbe6311.wfx -P -l -c -s 0.02
\end{lstlisting}

The above command was used for evaluating the data shown in Fig. \ref{fig:dtkproject6dto2dusex}. The output of the program consists of four files. The data for generating the three-dimensional and two-dimensional plots is saved in a \texttt{tsv} file. The data for the main and secondary diagonal (white solid and dashed line of figure \ref{fig:md12d}) are saved in two \texttt{dat} files. In addition, a \texttt{log} file is created, where some information about the position of the critical point (or the minimum of the ED) is located, etc.

As usual, the option \texttt{-P} requests the creation of plots. This program generates four of them. The names of the plots use the input wave function file name, adds the characters \texttt{BP} (if the bond path is selected), or \texttt{SL} if the straight line that joins two atoms (specified with the option \texttt{-a $\mathtt{a}_1$ $\mathtt{a}_2$}, see below), the labels of the selected atoms, and two or three characters to indicate the specific data displayed in the plot. The DM1 information is displayed as a surface (its name ends with \texttt{3D}), as a heat map (whose name ends with \texttt{2D}), and two simple plots that contains the DM1 values at the main diagonal (solid white line in Figure \ref{fig:md12d}, and whose name ends with \texttt{1D1}) and at the secondary diagonal (dashed white line in Figure \ref{fig:md12d}, and whose name ends with \texttt{1D2}).

The option \texttt{-l} makes \texttt{dtkproject6dto2d} to draw the labels of the atoms for the two dimensional and one-dimensional plots, while the option \texttt{-c} draws the contour lines as shown, for example, in Figure \ref{fig:md12d}.

By default, \texttt{dtkproject6dto2d} uses the first and second atoms of the \texttt{wfx/wfn} file. For selecting different atoms, you should use the option \texttt{-a $\mathtt{a}_1$ $\mathtt{a}_2$}, where \texttt{a}$_1$, and \texttt{a}$_2$ are the desired atoms.

As well, by default, the program will calculate the bond path between the atoms, and then use this curve to evaluate the DM1. However, in some cases is needed to evaluate the DM1 along the straight line that joins the atoms, which can be requested with the switch \texttt{-L}.

For increasing the number of points within the bond path line, you may want to look for a combination of the option \texttt{-s step} and \texttt{-n dim}. Here \texttt{step} orders \texttt{dtkproject6dto2d} to use the step \texttt{step} for the searching of the bond path (this is the step used in the Runge-Kutta integrator), while \texttt{dim} is the dimension of an array that contains the maximum number of points contained in the bond path. By default, \texttt{dtkproject6dto2d} sets \texttt{step=0.03}, and \texttt{dim=200}. When requesting to evaluate DM1 over the line that joins the atoms, \texttt{step} is no longer significant, rather the line will contain \texttt{dim} points.

In version \dtkversion, \texttt{dtkproject6dto2d} may compute and generate script to plot
the following 6D fields (projected onto a 2D grid):
\begin{itemize}
	\item Gradient of Density Matrix of order 1
	\item Laplacian of Density Matrix of order 1
	\item Closed-shell pair density function
	\item Open-shell pair density function
\end{itemize}

Figures similar to Fig.~\ref{fig:dtkproject6dto2dusex} can be produced simply by activating
option \texttt{-p}.

\section{dtkbpdens}
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This program seeks the bond path between two atoms and then evaluates the requested scalar/vector field at the points belonging to the bond path. This is specially meaningful when the bond path is not the straight line that joins the atoms, and especially in cases where they differ considerable such as in hydrogen bonds.

The data for producing Figure \ref{fig:dtkbpdensusex} was obtained by typing the two following commands.
\begin{lstlisting}
$dtkbpdens ciclopropano_pbe6311.wfx -P -l -s 0.02 -p M
$dtkbpdens ciclopropano_pbe6311.wfx -P -l -n 200 -p M -L
\end{lstlisting}

\includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{cyclopropaneBPSLMagGradLOL-C1-C2}
\caption{Evaluating the magnitude of LOL along the bond path}\label{fig:dtkbpdensusex}
\end{figure}
%

Plots will be generated by using option \texttt{-P}, and the labels of the atoms will be added activating the switch \texttt{-l}.

The step for the Runge-Kutta integrator can be set with the option \texttt{s step}, and the maximum number of points for the bond path is set with option \texttt{-n dim}. Here \texttt{dim} is the number of points requested for the arrays that contains the coordinates of the points belonging to the bond path.

If the property is evaluated at the line that join the atoms (activating the switch
\texttt{-L}), then the variable \texttt{step} is not used (whose default value is \texttt{step=0.03}).
Instead the value of \texttt{dim} is used to divide the line (the default value
for this variable is \texttt{dim=200}). The output will differ from the data obtained
with \texttt{dtkline} in the length of the line: \texttt{dtkbpdens} evaluates a field
between the atoms, while \texttt{dtkline} evaluates the property upon a longer line
that passes through the same atoms.

To choose the scalar field to plot, one simply uses the option \texttt{-p c}, where
\texttt{c} is a character that can be one of those included in the list shown in the menu (below).

As we can see in the help menu, the output file has a distinctive format. It contains the value of the variable used for the parametrization of the bond path (or straight line), the actual coordinates in the Cartesian system wherein the molecule is actually embedded, and finally the requested field.

%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{\label{sec:dtkqdmol}dtkqdmol}
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The purpose of this program is to provide a quick view of the molecule through the gnuplot interactive terminal. This is particularly useful for viewing the labels of the atoms, and to produce simple diagrams, such as the Figures \ref{fig:cyclopmolline} and \ref{fig:cyclopmolplane}.

\texttt{dtkqdmol} is \textit{not} intended to replace more powerful visualisation tools such as JMol, or the viewers included in the \textit{ab initio} calculation programs, but to serve as a command line program to improve the workflow of analyzing and evaluating properties, and also to adjust the view angles to be parsed to povray (see \texttt{dtkfindcp} section). In fact the name is a mnemonic name from \texttt{dtk quick draw molecule}.

The visualisation of the molecule is carried out using the stable and powerful interactive terminals of gnuplot. Usually the standard terminal under Unix-like and MacOSX systems is \texttt{x11} (chosen by default by \texttt{dtkqdmol}), and \texttt{windows} under Windows (also default when \texttt{dtkqdmol} is compiled with cygwin). However, one can specify a custom terminal by using the option \texttt{-t term}, where \texttt{term} is the desired terminal. We use quite regularly the terminals \texttt{x11} and \texttt{qt}; please ensure that \texttt{term} is working properly in your system and that is recognized by gnuplot.

The following command line should create a \texttt{gnp} file and immediately call gnuplot, which in turn opens an interactive window with the cyclopropane molecule. A snapshot of the opened window is shown in Fig. \ref{fig:dtkqdmolusex}\\
\begin{lstlisting}
$dtkqdmol ciclopropano_pbe6311.wfx -t qt -r
\end{lstlisting}
The option \texttt{-t qt} only works when the Qt terminal is installed in your system and properly linked to gnuplot.

To immediately call gnuplot, use the option \texttt{-r}. If this switch is not activated, the program will create the \texttt{gnp} file, which can be run later with gnuplot.

\section{\label{sec:dtkmapfieldonisosurf}dtkmapfieldonisosurf}
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Non-Covalent Interaction (NCI) index consists of visualising isosurfaces of the
reduced density gradient, coloured with the field $\Lambda_2\equiv\textrm{sign}(\lambda_2)\rho$.
Here $\lambda_2$ is the second eigenvalue of the Hessian (in ascending or descending order).

This index is useful to study weak non-covalent interactions between atoms in a molecule, especially
when there is no BCPs. $\Lambda_2<0$ indicates the interaction is attractive, and repulsive otherwise.

In the current version of \DTK, we have included this program (\texttt{dtknci}) to compute
one cube of cut-off reduced density gradient (see also the script \texttt{dtkgetnciplot}, in
\S\ref{sec:dtkgetnciplotdesc}). Subsequently, the program extracts an isosurface of this cube,
and computes $\Lambda_2$ upon the mesh of the isosurface. This information is used to
generate a povray script.

This program is recommended to be used together with the script \texttt{dtkgetnciplot}. The recommended workflow is as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Using \texttt{dtkgetnicplot}, generate the plot $s$ \textit{vs} $\rho$ (Fig. \ref{fig:svsrho}) with
	\begin{lstlisting}
$dtkgetnciplot -w h2oh2o.wfx -S 80 -l moreland
	\end{lstlisting}
	\item From the $s$ \textit{vs} $\rho$ plot, select the cut-off values for $\rho$ and $s$. In this case,
	the values were chosen as $s=0.5$, and  $-0.02\leq\Lambda_w\leq0.2$. This can be done with the command:
	\begin{lstlisting}
$dtkproject6dto2d h2oh2o.wfx -P -k -S 200 -I 0.5 -A 0 0 0 -l moreland --nci
	\end{lstlisting}
\end{enumerate}
%
\begin{figure}[hb!]
\centering
\subfigure[$s$ \textit{vs} $\rho$]{\includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{h2oh2oNCISvsRho}\label{fig:svsrho}}\quad
\subfigure[NCI]{\includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{h2oh2oNCI}\label{fig:nciiso}}
\caption{The NCI index of a two water molecules complex.}\label{fig:dtknci}
\end{figure}
%

After the step 2, you can experiment with the visualisation angles (through the option \texttt{-A}
or \texttt{-a}), withouth re-computing the cube: the option \texttt{-c} skips the cube computation.

This program needs to compute only the cube of the reduced density gradient, and internally computes
$\Lambda_2$ only at the vertices of the isosurface mesh. The number of vertices is much smaller
than the number of points of a relatively small grid. \textit{E.g.}, a cube of 80 points per side
requires evaluating a field ar 512000 points, and the isosurface usually contains a few thousand
vertices. Furthermore, the field $s$ is approximately three times faster to compute, relative to
the Hessian. Hence, this program reduces the CPU cost by avoiding the
computation of a Hessian cube, and only computing $\Lambda_2$ at the vertices of the isosurface.
If, in addition, the grid is set to be a \DTK{} smart cuboid, the computing time can be further reduced.

There are several colour schemes implemented in the current version,
which were generated from the data found in:\\
\url{https://github.com/Gnuplotting/gnuplot-palettes}.

In addition to the NCI plots, \texttt{dtkmapfieldonisosurf} can produce color maps of
any of the implemented fields over isosurfaces of any of the implemented fields. NCI is 
a specialized plot, so as it is DORI, but the user is not restricted to these
maps on isosurfaces of $\rho$.

\section{\label{sec:dtkpropcpsoniso}dtkpropcpsoniso}
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In version \dtkversion, the program \texttt{dtkpropcpsoniso} computes an electron density isosurface,
and a field evaluated at this isosurface. Subsequently, the program determines the surface
critical points of the evaluated field. There are two variants: a) the isosurface is
determined from a previous cube, and b) the isosurface is computed using a semisphere traced
around a requested atom (\textit{i.e.} a cap), and directed towards a direction vector
(also requested by the user).


Numerical information is saved in \texttt{*.log} files according to the
following convention:\\
\texttt{wfbasename{\color{blue}MEPCPsOnRho}{\color{red}III}.log}\\
\texttt{wfbasename} is the name of the wf? file (in this example \texttt{ccl2h}).\\
\texttt{\color{red}III} is either \texttt{Iso} or \texttt{Cap} depending on the method
used to compute the isosurface.

%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Cap isosurface}
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Figure \ref{fig:vsmaxcapopaq} was obtained with the command:
\begin{lstlisting}
$dtkpropcpsoniso ccl2h.wfn -P -k -c 13 -l 11 -r 4
\end{lstlisting}
In the above command, the option \texttt{-P} requests to render an image using \texttt{povray},
and the option \texttt{-k} requests to keep the pov script on disk. The option \texttt{-c 13} sets
the atom 13 to be the center around which the semisphere will be constructed, and the option
\texttt{-l 11} requests that the line that joins atoms 11 and 13 is used to direct the cap.
Figure \ref{fig:vsmaxcaptransp} was obtained by adding option \texttt{-t} to the above command.
%
\begin{figure}[ht!]
\centering
\subfigure[Opaque isosurface]{%
	\includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{ccl2hMEPCPsOnRhoCap}\label{fig:vsmaxcapopaq}%

}
\caption{$V_{S,max}$}\label{fig:vsmaxcap}
\end{figure}
%

The direction of the cap is indicated by on the options \texttt{-l}, \texttt{-m}, or
\texttt{-C}. Let us name $\boldsymbol c$ the position of the center atom
(\textit{i.e.}, the atom around which the cap is computed). The cap is directed along
the line $\boldsymbol d -\boldsymbol c$, where $\boldsymbol d$ is some point.
\texttt{dtkpropcpsoniso} provides three methods to define $\boldsymbol d$: a) the
position of another nucleus (option \texttt{-l}), b) the middle point of two nuclei
(option \texttt{-m}), and c) the centroid of three nuclei (option \texttt{-C}).

The contents of the \texttt{ccl2hMEPCPsOnRhoCap.log} file is:
\begin{scriptsize}
\begin{verbatim}
#The isosurface was computed using a cap surrounding atom 13
#Below, (x,y,z) is the position of each critical point (CP) found upon the surface.
#sigma is the signature of the CP; +2 indicates a local minimum, and -2 indicates a local maximum.
#atomIdxInWF? is the atom index in the wfn (or wfx) file, i.e. the number of
#  the atom in the list of atoms, of the closest atom to the CP.
#atomSymbol is the atomic symbol of the closest atom to the CP.
#        x                  y                  z        sigma       MEP   atomIdxInWF? atomSymbol

\end{verbatim}
\end{scriptsize}

\subsection{Isosurface from cube}
Figure \ref{fig:vsmaxiso} was obtained with the commands:
\begin{lstlisting}
$dtkcube ccl2h.wfn -S 80 -p d
$dtkpropcpsoniso ccl2h.wfn -P -k --use-cube ccl2hRho.cub
\end{lstlisting}
Here, the first command generates the cube \texttt{ccl2hRho.cub}, and
the second computes the $\rho$ isosurface, followed by the computation
of the Molecular Electrostatic Potential at the isosurface.

\section{\label{sec:dtkdrawer}dtkdrawer}
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This program is useful to draw molecules starting from the raw \texttt{wf?} file.
It is particularly useful to draw series of molecules without the need of opening
graphical user interfaces.

In addition to \texttt{wf?} files, \texttt{dtkdrawer} can draw molecules parsed in
\texttt{xyz} format, and the native \texttt{cpx} format, which is produced by
\texttt{dtkfindcp}.

The program will produce a \texttt{povray} file, and optionally it can call povray to
render the images.

Perhaps, the most interesting option is related to how the molecule is oriented (rotated)
to improve the visualization. For this, you can request to \texttt{drtkdrawer} to use
three atoms to align the molecule. The first two indicate how to orient the down to up
direction, and the third atom indicates how to orient the top (directed away from the screen).
This feature us particularly useful if you are analyzing a reaction path, as you can fix
the orientation of the complete set of intermediary molecules, in an automatic and
script-style fashion.

%**********************************************************************************************

There are several tasks which are highly repetitive during the processing of data. \DTK{} provides some scripts that perform very simple, but multi-command, tasks. For instance, it is often necessary to correct the bounding box of \texttt{eps} figures (a task done by \texttt{epstool}) and then produce a \texttt{pdf} file (which is done by \texttt{epstopdf}). Another often task is to render a \texttt{png} image from a \texttt{pov} file, especially when adjusting the view by setting the custom options (see \S\ref{sec:dtkfindcp}). The latter task can be easily executed with the script \texttt{dtkpov2png}. Below is the syntax and some options that can be used.

For the scripts, please note that the options must be written \textit{before} the name of the source file.

%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\section{dtkgetnciplot}\label{sec:dtkgetnciplotdesc}

This script generates cubes (Electron Density times the second Hessian eigenvalue, $\Lambda_2$,
and the reduced density gradient, $s$, both with
a cutoff) and a graph of Non Covalent Interactions, NCI (see \cite{bib:contreras2011}
for further details). We thank Luis Alfredo Nu\~nez Meneses, who was the main developer and current
maintainer of this script. Luis Alfredo developed \texttt{dtkgetnciplot} during his stay at our Lab
while he was developing his B.Sc. Thesis.

An example of how to use this script is as follows. First generate the cubes and the NCI plot
(here we assume the input wavefunction file is named ``wfname''):

\begin{lstlisting}
   $ dtkgetnciplot -w wfname.wfx
\end{lstlisting}

This instruction will generate a set of files, whose names are described in
Table \ref{tab:ncilistfiles}.

The default VMD-generated and pdf files will look as in figure \ref{fig:dtkgetnciplot} (the
option ``\texttt{-k}'' keeps the gnuplot file used to generate figure \ref{fig:formicAcidPlotNCI},
which can be modified by the user to change the style).

From the figure generated using default cutoffs, the user can refine the visualisation range and
cutoffs, such that the NCI can be better defined, as in figure \ref{fig:formicAcidVMDNCIcutoff}.
In version \dtkversion, the cubes must be re-computed.
\texttt{dtkgetnciplot} provides options to pass the custom cutoffs within the command line, as well
as to use the \textit{smart} features of \texttt{dtkcube} (see Section \ref{sec:dtkcube}).
For instance, the final data used to render figure \ref{fig:formicAcidVMDNCIcutoff} was
computed with the following command line:
%
\begin{lstlisting}
   dtkgetnciplot -w wfname.wfx -S 250 -r 0.0 -R 0.06 -G 0.6
\end{lstlisting}
%
\begin{figure}[hbt!]

\subfigure[$\rho vs \ S$]{\includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{NCISvsRho-Cutoff}\label{fig:formicAcidPlotNCIcutoff}}\quad
\subfigure[VMD visualisation]{\includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{NCIvmd-Cutoff}\label{fig:formicAcidVMDNCIcutoff}}
\caption{\texttt{dtkgetnciplot} output, after refining cutoffs.}\label{fig:dtkgetnciplotCutoff}
\end{figure}
%

Also, after the first pass, \textit{i.e.} after obtaining the data for rendering
Fig.~\ref{fig:dtkgetnciplot}, you can use the program \texttt{dtknci} (see \S\ref{sec:dtknci})
to reduce the CPU cost of computing the final NCI plot (cutting-off $s$ and $\Lambda_2$).
