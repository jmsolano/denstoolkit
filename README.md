# Git instructions

You can get DensToolKit's source code as follows.
In your bash terminal type:

~~~~~~~~~~
$cd /local/path/to/dtk
$git clone https://github.com/jmsolano/denstoolkit.git
~~~~~~~~~~

After this, git will transfer the source files to ```/local/path/to/dtk/denstoolkit```


# Building the package

## Auxiliary programs

Optionally, you may want to first run

~~~~~~~~~~
$/local/path/to/dtk/src/checkdependencies
~~~~~~~~~~

This will check that auxiliary programs (to plot the data computed by DensToolKit) are installed
in your system. You can skip this step if you are only interested in obtaining the numerical
data. You may process the data later with your preferred plotting program.

## Compilation

For building the binaries, type:

~~~~~~~~~~
$cd denstoolkit/src
$make -j 4
$sudo make install
~~~~~~~~~~

This should compile and install the binaries into ```/usr/local/bin```

# Testing the suite

If you want to test the correct compilation of the program, type:

~~~~~~~~~~
$ make runtest
$ 
~~~~~~~~~~

The above command will use the binaries present
in ```/local/path/to/dtk/denstoolkit/bin```, therefore, the
tests can be made without running ```sudo make install```.

# Updating DensToolKit

If you only need to get the latest version of DensToolKi, and you are not using
personal modifications to the source, in the local main directory (using the
above example should be ```/local/path/to/dtk/denstoolkit```):

~~~~~~~~~~
$git pull
$make distclean
$make
$sudo make install
~~~~~~~~~~

This should update your binaries in the local installation directory.


# Compiling with OpenMP

DensToolKit contains paralellized implementation of almost all basic functions. For using the parallel version (in this example with 4 cores), compile with the following commands:

~~~~~~~~~~
make SETDTKNPROC=4 -j4
~~~~~~~~~~

To use N processors, the above line, replace ```SETDTKNPROC=4``` by ```SETDTKNPROC=N```

~~~~~~~~~~
make SETDTKNPROC=N -j 4
~~~~~~~~~~

In the current version, it is not advised to use more than 4 Intel processors, nor more than 2 Apple M1 Silicon cores. There will be no speed improvement using more processors.

# DensToolKit manual
The manual, wherein some formal theory is developed, and also where more information about how to use the programs of the suite can be compiled or [downloaded by clicking here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1pqgAU6rK4YOTi__RhhrGYO4KTmBHcMZV?usp=sharing).

You can also compile the manual. For this, go to

~~~~~~~~~~
$ cd /local/path/to/dtk/tex/dtkmanual
$ pdflatex dtk-manual.tex
$ pdflatex dtk-manual.tex
$ pdflatex dtk-manual.tex
$ bibtex dtk-manual
$ pdflatex dtk-manual.tex
$ pdflatex dtk-manual.tex
~~~~~~~~~~

The file ```dtk-manual.pdf``` should be present in ```/local/path/to/dtk/tex/dtkmanual```.

# DensToolKitViewer
As of version 1.2.0, we provide an experimental graphical viewer. It is based on Qt, OpenGL, and GLUT. This program is under construction and is expected to change somewhat frequently in the near future. Unfortunately, this program requires a bit of extra-effort to compile it in Linux. For further instructions, please visit https://github.com/jmsolano/denstoolkit/tree/master/src/dtkview.
For MacOSX, we are temporarily distributing through JMSA's personal website:
