   Eigen-decomposition code for symmetric 6x6 matrices.

   The code below is a modification from the code found in 

   http://barnesc.blogspot.ca/2007/02/eigenvectors-of-3x3-symmetric-matrix.html

   In turn, the above modification has the following text:

   Eigen decomposition code for symmetric 6x6 matrices, copied from the public
   domain Java Matrix library JAMA.

/* Symmetric matrix A => eigenvectors in columns of V, corresponding
 eigenvalues in d. */
