=====================================================================
*** Version 1.0.4 ***
=====================================================================

--> A new plot is added in this version. dtkdemat1 is now able
      to evaluate the gradient of the density matrix of order
		1. This gradient is plotted in a new file, whose name
		ends in 2DV.pdf.
--> The number of contours can now be altered from the
      command line through the option -C s i e.

=====================================================================
*** Version 1.0.3 ***
=====================================================================

--> Improved the view of plots.
--> The range for the option -L was extended to be twice as long
      as the line joining the atoms.
--> Some labels, arrows, and new lines were modified/added.
--> The 3D plot now uses the option 'set xyplane 0'

=====================================================================
*** Version 1.0.3 ***
=====================================================================

--> Added two arrows in 1-D plots for pointing out the positions of
      the atoms at the corners.

To Do: Add conditional for the arrows (if the labels are not drawn,
     the arrows still are)
       Remove the labels in the secondary diagonal plot.



=====================================================================
*** Version 1.0.2 ***
=====================================================================

--> dtkdemat1 now produces 2 extra plots, which have the information
      of the main diagonal of MD1, and the secondary diagonal of MD1
--> The information is also stored in two new dat files.

=====================================================================
*** Version 1.0.1 ***
=====================================================================

--> Some additional support for cygwin is included

--> Both nuclei are included now in the Gradient Bond Path array

--> The atom labels are correctly displayed


=====================================================================
*** Version 1.0.0 ***
=====================================================================

First release of the program.
